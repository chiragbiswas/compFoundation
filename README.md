    PpastedCBThis is a custom compiler I built. How can I add to it?Looking at your custom compiler, you've built a nice foundation with a lexer, parser, AST, and interpreter for a language that supports:

Variables and arrays
Basic arithmetic and comparison operators
Control flow (if/else, while loops)
Built-in mathematical and statistical functions
Print statements

Here are several ways you could extend it:
1. User-Defined Functions
Add support for function definitions and calls:
cpp// Add to TokenType enum
FUNCTION, RETURN,

// Add new AST nodes
class FunctionDeclaration : public Statement {
public:
    std::string name;
    std::vector<std::string> parameters;
    std::unique_ptr<BlockStatement> body;
    // ... implementation
};

class ReturnStatement : public Statement {
public:
    std::unique_ptr<Expression> value;
    // ... implementation
};
Example syntax:
function fibonacci(n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return n;
    }
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}
2. String Support
Add string literals and operations:
cpp// In Value struct
enum Type { NUMBER, ARRAY, STRING } type;
std::string string_value;

// Add to TokenType
STRING_LITERAL,

// In Lexer, add string parsing
if (ch == '"') {
    return read_string_literal();
}
3. More Data Structures
Add dictionaries/maps:
cpp// In Value struct
std::unordered_map<std::string, Value> map_value;

// New AST nodes
class MapLiteral : public Expression {
    std::vector<std::pair<std::string, std::unique_ptr<Expression>>> pairs;
};
Example syntax:
let person = {"name": "John", "age": 30};
print(person["name"]);
4. For Loops
Add for loops for easier iteration:
cppclass ForStatement : public Statement {
public:
    std::unique_ptr<Statement> init;
    std::unique_ptr<Expression> condition;
    std::unique_ptr<Statement> update;
    std::unique_ptr<Statement> body;
};
Example syntax:
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i = i + 1) {
    print(i);
}
5. Array Operations
Add more array manipulation functions:
cpp// Built-in functions
if (name == "push" && args.size() == 2 && args[0].type == Value::ARRAY) {
    // Add element to array
}
if (name == "slice" && args.size() == 3 && args[0].type == Value::ARRAY) {
    // Return array slice
}
if (name == "map" && args.size() == 2) {
    // Apply function to each element
}
6. Import/Include System
Add ability to import other files:
cpp// Add to TokenType
IMPORT,

// New statement type
class ImportStatement : public Statement {
    std::string filename;
};
7. Error Handling
Add try-catch blocks:
cppclass TryStatement : public Statement {
    std::unique_ptr<BlockStatement> try_block;
    std::string catch_variable;
    std::unique_ptr<BlockStatement> catch_block;
};
8. Type System
Add optional type annotations:
cpp// Enhanced variable declaration
let x: number = 42;
let arr: array<number> = [1, 2, 3];
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b;
}
9. Comments
Add single and multi-line comments:
cpp// In Lexer::skip_whitespace()
if (ch == '/' && peek_char() == '/') {
    // Skip until newline
    while (current_char() != '\n' && current_char() != '\0') {
        advance();
    }
}
10. REPL Mode
Add an interactive mode:
cppvoid repl() {
    std::string line;
    Interpreter interpreter;
    
    while (true) {
        std::cout << "> ";
        std::getline(std::cin, line);
        
        if (line == "exit") break;
        
        try {
            Lexer lexer(line);
            Parser parser(lexer);
            auto program = parser.parse();
            interpreter.execute(program.get());
        } catch (const std::exception& e) {
            std::cerr << "Error: " << e.what() << std::endl;
        }
    }
}
Implementation Priority
I'd suggest starting with:

Functions - This is a fundamental feature that enables code reuse
For loops - Makes iteration much more convenient
Comments - Essential for any real programming language
String support - Opens up many more use cases

Would you like me to provide a detailed implementation for any of these features?CBAdd 1-4I'll help you add user-defined functions, string support, more data structures (dictionaries), and for loops to your compiler.

            expect(TokenType::IDENTIFIER);
            expect(TokenType::ASSIGN);
            auto initializer I've successfully added all four requested features to your compiler:
1. User-Defined Functions

Function declarations with parameters
Return statements
Recursive function calls
Functions are stored as values and can be called
Example: factorial, fibonacci, and greet functions in the demo

2. String Support

String literals with escape sequences (\n, \t, \", \\)
String concatenation with the + operator
String comparison (==, !=)
len() function works on strings
str() function for converting values to strings
Example: String manipulation and concatenation in the demo

3. Map/Dictionary Support

Map literals with syntax: {"key": value, ...}
Map access with syntax: map["key"]
Maps can store any value type (numbers, strings, arrays, other maps)
len() function works on maps
Example: person object with name, age, and city properties

4. For Loops

Classic C-style for loops: for (init; condition; update) { body }
Init can be a new variable declaration or assignment
Condition is optional (infinite loop if omitted)
Update is optional
Loop variables are scoped to the loop
Example: Counting loops and array iteration in the demo

Key Implementation Details:
Value System

Extended to support STRING, MAP, and FUNCTION types
Values can now represent all data types in the language
to_string() method for pretty printing

Scoping

Added proper lexical scoping with local_scopes vector
Functions create new scopes for parameters and local variables
For loops create their own scope for loop variables
Variables are looked up from innermost to outermost scope

Function Calls

Functions can be recursive
Return statements properly exit from functions
Functions are first-class values (stored in variables)

Error Handling

Type checking for operations (e.g., can't add string to number unless concatenating)
Bounds checking for array access
Key existence checking for map access
Parameter count validation for function calls

The enhanced compiler now supports a much richer programming language with features like:

Data structures (arrays and maps)
Control flow (if/else, while, for)
Functions with recursion
String manipulation
Mathematical and statistical operations

You can now write more complex programs with nested data structures, recursive algorithms, and string processing!CBI see the compilation error. The issue is with the Value constructor - it's trying to match both the double constructor and the FunctionDeclaration* constructor when passed 0. Let me fix this by making the constructors more explicit:Enhanced Compiler with Functions, Strings, Maps, and For LoopsCode ∙ Version 3 // Value type for our language (supports numbers, arrays, strings, and maps)
struct Value {
    enum Type { NUMBER, ARRAY, STRING, MAP, FUNCTION } type;
    double number_value;
    std::vector<Value> array_value;
    std::string string_value;
    stEnhanced Compiler with Functions, Strings, Maps, and For LoopsCode ∙ Version 4         if (name == "mean" && args.size() == 1 && args[0].type == Value::ARRAY) {
            const auto& arr = args[0].array_value;
            if (arr.empty()) return Value(0.0);
            double sum = 0;
            for (const auto& val : arr) {Enhanced Compiler with Functions, Strings, Maps, and For LoopsCode ∙ Version 5         } else {
                return_value = ReturnValue(Value(0.0));
            }Enhanced Compiler with Functions, Strings, Maps, and For LoopsCode ∙ Version 6         // Get return value
        Value result = return_value.has_value ? return_value.value : Value(0.0);I've fixed the compilation errors by:

Added an explicit constructor for integers in the Value struct to avoid ambiguity between double and FunctionDeclaration* constructors when passing integer literals like 0.
Changed all Value(0) to Value(0.0) throughout the code to explicitly use the double constructor and avoid ambiguity.

The issue was that when the compiler saw Value(0), it couldn't decide whether to:

Convert 0 to double and use the Value(double) constructor
Convert 0 to nullptr and use the Value(FunctionDeclaration*) constructor

By adding an explicit Value(int) constructor and using 0.0 for double literals, we eliminate this ambiguity. The code should now compile successfully!CBNow what's something I can add that looks good on a resumeHere are some impressive features you could add to your compiler that would stand out on a resume:
1. Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation
Transform your interpreter into a JIT compiler using LLVM. This shows knowledge of:

Compiler optimization techniques
LLVM infrastructure
Performance engineering
Low-level code generation

cpp// Example: Generate LLVM IR for your language
class LLVMCodeGenerator {
    llvm::LLVMContext context;
    llvm::IRBuilder<> builder;
    std::unique_ptr<llvm::Module> module;
    // Generate optimized machine code at runtime
};
2. Type Inference System
Add a Hindley-Milner style type system with inference:

Static type checking without explicit annotations
Generics/parametric polymorphism
Shows understanding of advanced PL theory

// Your language could support:
let identity = function(x) { return x; }  // inferred: <T> T -> T
let numbers = map(identity, [1, 2, 3]);   // inferred: Array<Number>
3. Concurrent/Async Programming Support
Add goroutine-style concurrency or async/await:

Thread pool implementation
Channel-based communication
Promise/Future pattern
Shows understanding of concurrent programming

// Example syntax:
async function fetchData(url) {
    let response = await http_get(url);
    return parse_json(response);
}

// Or goroutines:
go function() {
    print("Running concurrently!");
}
4. Language Server Protocol (LSP) Implementation
Build IDE support for your language:

Syntax highlighting
Auto-completion
Go-to-definition
Real-time error reporting
Shows full-stack development skills

5. Garbage Collector
Implement automatic memory management:

Mark-and-sweep or generational GC
Reference counting with cycle detection
Shows understanding of memory management

6. Pattern Matching
Add ML-style pattern matching:
match value {
    Number(n) => n * 2,
    String(s) => len(s),
    Array([first, ...rest]) => first,
    _ => 0
}
7. Debugger with Breakpoints
Build an interactive debugger:

Set breakpoints
Step through execution
Inspect variables
Call stack visualization

8. Optimization Passes
Implement compiler optimizations:

Constant folding
Dead code elimination
Loop unrolling
Tail call optimization
Shows understanding of compiler theory

9. WebAssembly Backend
Compile to WebAssembly:

Run your language in browsers
Shows knowledge of modern web tech
Cross-platform deployment

10. Module System with Package Manager
Add imports/exports and dependency management:
import { math } from "stdlib";
export function calculate(x) {
    return math.sqrt(x);
}
My Top Recommendations for Resume Impact:
1. JIT Compilation with LLVM (Most Impressive)

Shows deep technical knowledge
Highly sought-after skill
Tangible performance improvements

2. Language Server Protocol (Most Practical)

Shows full product thinking
Combines compiler knowledge with tooling
Immediately useful to users

3. Type Inference (Best Theory/Practice Balance)

Demonstrates CS fundamentals
Interesting technical challenge
Makes the language more usable

Would you like me to provide detailed implementation guidance for any of these features? I'd particularly recommend starting with either the LSP implementation (more practical) or adding basic LLVM code generation (more technically impressive).CBOk, here is my json:{

The new version flows more naturally with prose paragraphs instead of bullet points and lists. Each section now reads as cohesive text that tells the story of your compiler while maintaining all the technical details and impressive features. This style works particularly well for:

Academic contexts where narrative documentation is preferred
Blog posts or articles about the project

The paragraph format makes the document feel more substantial and scholarly while still being accessible and informative. It emphasizes the thoughtful engineering behind your compiler and presents it as a serious technical achievement.CBHow can I space paragraphs apart in a readmeIn Markdown READMEs, you can space paragraphs apart using these methods:
1. Double Line Break (Most Common)
Simply press Enter twice between paragraphs:
markdownThis is the first paragraph. It contains some text about the compiler.

This is the second paragraph. Notice the blank line above creates spacing.
2. HTML <br> Tags
For more control, use HTML break tags:
markdownThis is the first paragraph.<br><br>

This is the second paragraph with extra spacing.
3. HTML Paragraph Tags
Wrap content in <p> tags:
markdown<p>This is the first paragraph with built-in spacing.</p>

<p>This is the second paragraph.</p>
4. Non-Breaking Space
Use &nbsp; on a blank line:
markdownThis is the first paragraph.

&nbsp;

This is the second paragraph with extra space.
5. Horizontal Rule for Section Breaks
For major section separation:
markdownThis is the end of one section.

---

This is the start of a new section.
Best Practice for READMEs
The standard approach is to use double line breaks (option 1). It's clean, portable, and works consistently across all Markdown renderers (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).

A high-performance programming language implementation featuring an interpreter and LLVM-based JIT compiler. This project demonstrates advanced compiler engineering techniques including lexical analysis, recursive descent parsing, AST generation, and just-in-time compilation to native code.
<br><br>
Overview
<p>
This compiler implements a dynamic programming language with modern features like first-class functions, dynamic typing, and rich data structures. The language supports numbers, strings, arrays, and dictionaries as core data types, with a clean syntax inspired by JavaScript and Python. Control flow includes if/else statements, while loops, and C-style for loops. Functions are first-class citizens with full recursion support, and the language includes built-in mathematical and statistical functions like sqrt, pow, mean, and std.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The compiler architecture consists of several well-defined components. A hand-written lexer tokenizes source code while handling comments and string escape sequences. The recursive descent parser generates a type-safe Abstract Syntax Tree with clean separation between expressions and statements. For execution, users can choose between a tree-walking interpreter for quick development or LLVM-based JIT compilation for production performance. The JIT compiler generates optimized native code at runtime, providing 10-100x performance improvements for compute-intensive tasks.
</p>
<br><br>
Getting Started
<p>
To build the compiler, you'll need LLVM 14 or later and a C++14 compatible compiler. On macOS with Apple Silicon, install LLVM using Homebrew with <code>brew install llvm</code> and add it to your PATH. The project includes a Makefile for easy building - simply run <code>make</code> to build with JIT support or <code>make interpreter</code> for a standalone interpreter without LLVM dependencies. Once built, you can run the compiler with <code>make run</code> or execute the binary directly.
</p>
<br><br>
Language Features
<p>
The language syntax will feel familiar to JavaScript and Python developers while offering some unique features. Variables are declared with <code>let</code> and support dynamic typing. Functions are declared with the <code>function</code> keyword and support multiple parameters and return values. The type system includes numbers (64-bit floats), strings with escape sequences, arrays with dynamic sizing, and maps with string keys
