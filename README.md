Custom Language Compiler with JIT
A high-performance programming language implementation featuring an interpreter and LLVM-based JIT compiler. This project demonstrates advanced compiler engineering techniques including lexical analysis, recursive descent parsing, AST generation, and just-in-time compilation to native code. /n
Overview
This compiler implements a dynamic programming language with modern features like first-class functions, dynamic typing, and rich data structures. The language supports numbers, strings, arrays, and dictionaries as core data types, with a clean syntax inspired by JavaScript and Python. Control flow includes if/else statements, while loops, and C-style for loops. Functions are first-class citizens with full recursion support, and the language includes built-in mathematical and statistical functions like sqrt, pow, mean, and std.
The compiler architecture consists of several well-defined components. A hand-written lexer tokenizes source code while handling comments and string escape sequences. The recursive descent parser generates a type-safe Abstract Syntax Tree with clean separation between expressions and statements. For execution, users can choose between a tree-walking interpreter for quick development or LLVM-based JIT compilation for production performance. The JIT compiler generates optimized native code at runtime, providing 10-100x performance improvements for compute-intensive tasks.
Getting Started
To build the compiler, you'll need LLVM 14 or later and a C++14 compatible compiler. On macOS with Apple Silicon, install LLVM using Homebrew with brew install llvm and add it to your PATH. The project includes a Makefile for easy building - simply run make to build with JIT support or make interpreter for a standalone interpreter without LLVM dependencies. Once built, you can run the compiler with make run or execute the binary directly.
Language Features
The language syntax will feel familiar to JavaScript and Python developers while offering some unique features. Variables are declared with let and support dynamic typing. Functions are declared with the function keyword and support multiple parameters and return values. The type system includes numbers (64-bit floats), strings with escape sequences, arrays with dynamic sizing, and maps with string keys.
